### 🚀 About Me
I'm a curious and quick-thinking Data Engineer at **KFINTECH**, working from Bhubaneswar 🇮🇳. With a passion for **Data Engineering** and **Machine Learning**, I thrive at the intersection of data, technology, and real-world impact.

🔍 I’ve gained hands-on experience in the **Mutual Funds industry**, solving complex problems in:
- 📊 Data Analytics & Fraud Detection
- 🔄 ETL Pipelines & Data Workflows
- ⚙️ Database Maintenance & Query Optimization
- 🤖 Automation for System Performance

💡 I love crafting scalable data pipelines, collaborating across teams, and constantly pushing for process efficiency and clarity through documentation.

🌊 Outside the tech realm, I’m passionate about **Electronics & Underwater Robotics** – where innovation meets exploration.
